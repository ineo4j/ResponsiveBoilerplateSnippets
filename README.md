## How to use

- We **strongly** recommend the use of Sublime Text 2 (I have not yet tested the new version 3).
- Download or clone the repo on your machine.
- Copy and paste the folder: ResponsiveBoilerplateSnippets into your Packages.
- If you have problems to find your Sublime Text packages folder, open your editor, click preferences on the top bar menu, choose Browse Packages, so you find the folder. wow.
- Just type Rbcol, Rbcontainer, Rbclear etc... and you see a dropdown menu with respective class.


_Remembering that, these snippets are exclusive part of the Responsive Boilerplate Framework and certainly will not work outside the folder structure framework._
