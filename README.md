# ResponsiveBoilerplateSnippets


> Sublime Text2 snippets to use with **Responsive Boilerplate**.

---

A bunch of nicely and very useful [ResponsiveBoilerplate](http://www.responsiveboilerplate/) code snippets for [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) editor.

## Installation

We have 3 options to install the snippets _(We prefer the third option)_.

*1.*  Clone the repository into your packages folder.

    git clone git@github.com:newaeonweb/ResponsiveBoilerplateSnippets.git

*2.*  Download the [.zip](https://github.com/newaeonweb/ResponsiveBoilerplateSnippets/archive/master.zip) file and unzip it into your ST2 packages directory.

*3.*  Using the Sublime Text Package Control, the easy way!

## How to use

- We **strongly** recommend the use of Sublime Text 2 (I have not yet tested the new version 3).
- Just type Rb on the snippets window and you'll see a dropdown menu with all classes availabe.

_Remembering that, these snippets are exclusive part of the Responsive Boilerplate Library and certainly will not work outside the Responsive Boilerplate folder structure._
